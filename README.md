Overview
The code in this repository is designed to predict future sales based on historical sales data. It uses a machine learning model to make these predictions. This README will guide you through the steps to run the code and make accurate sales predictions.

Dependencies
Before you begin, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
usage
clone the repository.git clone https://github.com/Gokii-kila/future sales prediction.git
Python (version 3.6 or higher)
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib (optional for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the code interactively)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd sales-prediction
Create a virtual environment (recommended but optional):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the project dependencies in your virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
To use your own sales data, replace the data/sales_data.csv file with your dataset. Ensure that your dataset has at least the following columns:

date: The date of the sale.
sales: The sales amount for that date.
Running the Code
Open the Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the sales_prediction.ipynb file in the Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the machine learning model, make predictions, and visualize the results.

Alternatively, you can run the code directly by executing the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python sales_prediction.py
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and provide sales predictions for future dates.

Configuration
You can adjust various parameters, such as the choice of machine learning algorithm, hyperparameters, and the time horizon for predictions by modifying the config.json file.

Dataset Source:

Data Provider: The dataset is provided by a fictional retail company, "SuperMart Inc."
Data Source: The data is collected from SuperMart Inc.'s point-of-sale (POS) system and sales records.
Data Access: You can obtain the dataset by requesting access from SuperMart Inc. or by using a publicly available retail sales dataset from a reliable source like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Dataset Description:

Name: SuperMart Inc. Sales Data

Purpose: The dataset is intended for building a machine learning model to predict future sales.

Content: The dataset includes historical sales data for a specified time period. It typically includes the following fields:

Date: The date of the sales transaction.

Store ID: A unique identifier for each store in the retail chain.
Product ID: A unique identifier for each product.
Sales Amount: The total sales amount for a given product on a specific date.
Quantity Sold: The quantity of a product sold on a specific date.
Price: The unit price of the product.
Store Features: Additional features that describe each store (e.g., location, size, number of employees, promotions).
Product Features: Additional features that describe each product (e.g., category, brand, seasonality).
Data Preparation:

The dataset may require preprocessing to handle missing values, convert categorical data into numerical format, and extract relevant features for prediction.
Machine Learning Model:

You can use various machine learning algorithms for sales prediction, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or time series forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet.
You'll split the dataset into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the model's performance.
Evaluation Metrics:

Common evaluation metrics for sales prediction models include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
Usage:
clone the repository.git clone https://github.com/Gokii-kila/future sales prediction.git
The trained machine learning model can be used to predict future sales for different stores and products, helping SuperMart Inc. optimize inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies.
Remember to adhere to data privacy and ethical guidelines when using real-world data and ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and use the data. Additionally, data quality and feature engineering play a crucial role in the success of your sales prediction model, so careful data preprocessing is essential.
